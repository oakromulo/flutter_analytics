## 7.3.2

* Prepare for 1.0.0 version of sensors and package_info. ([dart_lsc](http://github.com/amirh/dart_lsc))

## [v7.3.1](https://github.com/oakromulo/flutter_analytics/tree/v7.3.1) - 2020-03-11

- Header `batch` added in order to roughly identify the encoded `batch` on the body, simplifying
  server-side handling of repeated client upload attempts including the same initial subset of
  analytics events.
- Improved/safer uuidV4 generator for `anonymousId` (fallback in case of failed/unavailable `udid`),
  `messageId` and `sessionId`.
- Rudimentary 1ms throttling mechanism added between events being fired/buffered.
- Sessions now also get reset whenever `userId` changes (via `identify` calls).
- Updated dependencies: `connectivity` and `path_provider`.

- Fix [location](https://pub.dev/packages/location) plugin hanging due to either location services
  disabled (PR [#267](https://github.com/Lyokone/flutterlocation/pull/267)) or race conditions
  (issue [#281](https://github.com/Lyokone/flutterlocation/issues/281)).

## [v6.3.1](https://github.com/oakromulo/flutter_analytics/tree/v6.3.1) - 2020-02-14

- Automatic lifecycle tracking removed so that the SDK never fires an implicit event without
  explicit user action.
- Refactored internal sequential event buffers.
- Auto-setup when host application resumes from background (at least one previous successful setup
  is required).
- Auto-flush attempt when host application goes into background.

## [v6.0.1](https://github.com/oakromulo/flutter_analytics/tree/v6.0.1) - 2020-02-11

- Breaking change: singleton instantion of `Analytics` objects instead of static calls.

  encode datetime in release mode
